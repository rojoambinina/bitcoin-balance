# bitcoin-balance
### Copyrith 2016 - written by Rojo Ambinina

This code is only for generating compressed and uncompressed bitcoins addresses with their balances, and also displays the privates keys at the same time. The algorithm generates bitcoin addresses until it finds a non-zero balance and stores it in a text file "Lottery_BTC.txt"

Using it is easy, you only have to type the command below to install the bitcoin module:

## pip install bitcoin

Then just go to the folder containing the file "btc-balance.py" to run the algorithm:

## py btc-balance.py

This code is only for example study and does not run too fast to avoid spamming Blockchain, but you can modify it by adding the multiprocessing module.
