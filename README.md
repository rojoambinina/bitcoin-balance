# Bitcoin Address Balance
**Copyright 2016 - Written by Rojo Ambinina**

This code is only for generating compressed and uncompressed bitcoins addresses with their balances, and also displays the privates keys at the same time. The algorithm generates bitcoin addresses until it finds a non-zero balance and stores it in a text file "Lottery_BTC.txt"

Using it is easy, you only have to type the command below to install bitcoin module:

## pip install bitcoin

Then just go to the folder containing the file "bitcoin-balance.py" to run the algorithm and type:

## py bitcoin-balance.py

This code is just a study example and does not run too fast to avoid spamming Blockchain Server, but you can modify it by adding the multiprocessor module.
